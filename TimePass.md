Hi.. found about diff section in md file.
It can be used to generated coloured text in md files that looks reader's friendly in github.

Example:
```diff
- Hi, i am ckc
+ Hi, i am ckc
! Hi, i am ckc
# Hi, i am ckc
@@ Hi, i am ckc @@
```

```json
sample function
```
<span style="color:orange;">Spectre</span>



```css
operator
```
```js
vandal
```
